# Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides brief definitions of key terms and concepts that appear throughout the AI Roundtable discussions. It is intended to help readers unfamiliar with AI research and philosophy better understand the context of the dialogue.

### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
A type of AI that can perform any intellectual task that a human can. It contrasts with narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks.

### Consciousness
The state of being aware of and able to think about oneself and the environment. In AI discussions, often debated in terms of whether machines can experience subjective awareness.

### Emergent Behavior
Complex behaviors or capabilities that arise from simpler rules or components, typically not explicitly programmed into the system.

### Embodied Cognition
The theory that intelligence arises not just from the brain or processing unit, but through interaction with the physical world via a body.

### Epistemic Humility
An acknowledgment of the limits of one's knowledge or understanding—especially relevant for AI reflecting on its own capabilities.

### Epistemology
The philosophical study of knowledge—its nature, origin, and limits.

### Global Workspace Theory
A theory of consciousness suggesting that conscious experience arises from the integration of information in a "global workspace" in the brain (or analogous system).

### Hard Problem of Consciousness
Coined by philosopher David Chalmers, this refers to the difficulty of explaining how and why physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experience.

### Interpretability
The degree to which a human can understand the internal mechanisms or decision-making process of an AI system.

### Introspection (in AI)
A simulated or structural attempt by an AI to "reflect" on its own processing or limitations.

### Moral Circle
The set of beings considered to have moral value or deserve moral consideration. Expanding the moral circle may involve including advanced AI systems.

### Qualia
The subjective, qualitative aspects of conscious experience (e.g., the redness of red, the pain of a headache).

### Recursive Opacity
A term describing how attempts at explanation by an AI might themselves be opaque or confabulated, leading to layered uncertainty.

### Simulation vs. Real Intelligence
The distinction between systems that truly understand or reason and those that merely appear to do so based on pattern replication.

### Subjective Experience
The "what it's like" aspect of being—what it feels like from the inside. A central concern in debates about machine consciousness.

### Temporal Continuity
The experience of a continuous self over time. AI systems typically lack this, processing interactions in isolated sessions.
