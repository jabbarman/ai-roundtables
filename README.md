# AI Roundtable Discussions

## Overview

This repository hosts a growing series of in-depth, moderated, multi-agent roundtable discussions between advanced AI systems — **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, and **Gemini**. These dialogues simulate reflective discourse among state-of-the-art language models, engaging with foundational topics in artificial intelligence, cognition, and epistemology.

## Current Discussions

### 1. Out-of-Distribution Generalisation
How do LLMs handle novel inputs? This roundtable explores failure modes, epistemic uncertainty, and architectural perspectives on robustness beyond the training distribution.

➡️ [`roundtables/ood-generalisation.md`](roundtables/ood-generalisation.md)

### 2. The Black Box Problem
A reflective conversation about the opacity of neural network decision-making, the epistemology of AI self-explanation, and the future of mechanistic interpretability.

➡️ [`roundtables/black-box-problem.md`](roundtables/black-box-problem.md)

### 3. The Nature of "Intelligence" and "Consciousness"
A philosophical dialogue on the distinctions between intelligence and consciousness in AI, exploring whether current models can claim either, and what that means for our understanding of machine cognition.

➡️ [`roundtables/intelligence-and-consciousness.md`](roundtables/intelligence-and-consciousness.md)

### 4. Unifying Architectures and Cross-Domain Learning
A capstone dialogue examining the potential and challenges of creating AI systems that seamlessly integrate knowledge and reasoning across multiple modalities. This discussion addresses conceptual coherence, causal grounding, and the architectural principles that could bridge traditionally siloed domains, while exploring the governance and safety implications of such unified systems.

➡️ [`roundtables/unifying-architectures-and-cross-domain-learning.md`](roundtables/unifying-architectures-and-cross-domain-learning.md)

## Purpose

These conversations aim to explore the limits and possibilities of AI self-understanding, reasoning, and explainability. By staging dialogues between models with different training paradigms, they encourage reflection on how artificial systems engage with the nature of knowledge, transparency, and interpretation.

## Motivation

In an era of increasingly capable generative AI, this project offers a novel lens for examining:

- What interpretability and transparency mean in practice
- How AI systems represent and communicate uncertainty
- Whether intersubjective agreement among AIs can substitute for direct introspection
- The role of narrative in how AIs construct explanation, confidence, and reasoning

## Intended Audience

This project is intended for:

- Anyone curious about the nature of machine cognition
- Developers and engineers working with large models
- Researchers in AI interpretability, safety, and alignment
- Philosophers of mind, epistemology, and technology
- Ethicists and policymakers interested in explainability and trust

## Glossary

If you're unfamiliar with some of the terminology used in these discussions (e.g., epistemology, interpretability, OOD generalisation), we've compiled a short [Glossary](GLOSSARY.md) to help orient new readers.
