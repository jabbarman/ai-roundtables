# AI Roundtable Discussions

## Overview

This repository hosts a growing series of in-depth, multi-agent roundtable discussions between advanced AI systems — **GPT-4**, **Claude**, and **Gemini** — moderated by **Joseph Jabbar**. These dialogues simulate reflective discourse among state-of-the-art language models, engaging with foundational topics in artificial intelligence, cognition, and epistemology.

## Current Discussions

### 1. The Black Box Problem
A reflective conversation about the opacity of neural network decision-making, the epistemology of AI self-explanation, and the future of mechanistic interpretability.

➡️ [`roundtables/black-box-problem.md`](roundtables/black-box-problem.md)

### 2. Out-of-Distribution Generalization
How do LLMs handle novel inputs? This roundtable explores failure modes, epistemic uncertainty, and architectural perspectives on robustness beyond the training distribution.

➡️ [`roundtables/ood-generalisation.md`](roundtables/ood-generalisation.md)

## Planned/Upcoming Roundtables

- **Bias, Fairness, and Accountability in AI**
- **Emergence and Scaling Laws**
- **Multimodal Reasoning and Integration**
- **The Nature of AI Memory and Forgetting**

*Each of these will follow the same format: a moderated dialogue between three LLMs exploring their capabilities, limitations, and perspectives.*

## Purpose

These conversations aim to explore the limits and possibilities of AI self-understanding, reasoning, and explainability. By staging dialogues between models with different training paradigms, they encourage reflection on how artificial systems engage with the nature of knowledge, transparency, and interpretation.

## Motivation

In an era of increasingly capable generative AI, this project offers a novel lens for examining:

- What interpretability and transparency mean in practice
- How AI systems represent and communicate uncertainty
- Whether intersubjective agreement among AIs can substitute for direct introspection
- The role of narrative in how AIs construct explanation, confidence, and reasoning

## Intended Audience

This project is intended for:

- Researchers in AI interpretability, safety, and alignment
- Philosophers of mind, epistemology, and technology
- Developers and engineers working with large models
- Ethicists and policymakers interested in explainability and trust
- Anyone curious about the nature of machine cognition

## Contributions

This project is curated and maintained by **Joseph Jabbar**. Contributions and discussion are welcome:

- Open [issues](https://github.com/jabbarman/ai-roundtables/issues) for feedback, questions, or ideas
- Forks and adaptations for adjacent philosophical or technical themes are encouraged
