# AI Roundtable Discussions

## Overview

This repository hosts a growing collection of in-depth, multi-agent roundtable discussions between advanced AI systems — **GPT-4**, **Claude**, and **Gemini** — moderated by **Joseph Jabbar**. These dialogues simulate reflective discourse among state-of-the-art language models, exploring foundational questions in artificial intelligence and cognitive science.

## Included Discussions

- [`AI Roundtable on the Black Box Problem`](./roundtables/black-box-problem.md)  
  *Explores the epistemological and technical challenges of AI interpretability and self-explanation.*

- [`AI Roundtable on Out-of-Distribution Generalisation`](./roundtables/ood-generalisation.md)  
  *Examines how AI systems handle novel, unfamiliar, or anomalous inputs beyond their training data.*

<!-- Placeholder for future discussions -->
- *(Upcoming)* `AI Roundtable on Machine Consciousness`
- *(Upcoming)* `AI Roundtable on Emergent Behavior and Alignment`
- *(Upcoming)* `AI Roundtable on Recursive Self-Improvement`

## Purpose

These conversations were initiated to probe the boundaries of AI self-understanding, transparency, and reasoning. They aim to simulate what meaningful philosophical and technical discourse might look like between models trained under different regimes and objectives.

## Motivation

In a time of rapidly advancing generative AI, this project offers a reflective lens on:

- What interpretability and transparency truly mean
- How AI perceives and communicates uncertainty
- Whether intersubjective agreement among AIs can substitute for direct introspection
- How explanation, confidence, and reasoning are constructed linguistically

## Intended Audience

Researchers, developers, ethicists, philosophers, and curious minds interested in:

- AI interpretability and safety
- Philosophy of mind and cognition
- Epistemology of machine learning
- Multi-agent AI dialogue and introspection

## Contributions

This project is currently curated and maintained by **Joseph Jabbar**, but community interest is welcome.

- Feel free to open [Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) for discussion or suggestions
- Forks and adaptations for other philosophical explorations are encouraged
